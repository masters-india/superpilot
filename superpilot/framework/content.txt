Let us examine the Haryana case and be objective.
Violence was started most probably by Muslims. Was it correct - No. Are Muslims being arrested - Yes. Are their homes being bulldozed - Yes.
Should Muslims be outraged when Monu Manesar shares videos - Yes. Should they be violent - No. Should these Monu types be arrested for hate speech - Yes. Are they ever arrested and their homes bulldozed - No.
Monu is a prime suspect in the burning of two Muslim youths - Yes. Has he been arrested - No. Is Monu's home being bulldozed - No.
Did state machinery fail in controlling the violence - Yes. Did state intelligence fail in understanding how tense the situation was before the riots - Yes.
There was retaliation in Gurugram after Nuh violence. Imam was killed. Any homes bulldozed yet - No.
You can arrive at your own conclusions by asking questions and answering them honestly. The key is in asking the right questions.

In the case of Haryana, one could say that the truth lies in the middle. But look at the facts; this goon of a guy who is accused of burning two men alive for suspected cow trading (or whatever), openly challenges the Muslim community that he's coming and provokes them that they can't do shit and blah blah blah. Think about that for a minute. How would the minority community react? Not everyone is mature. Most senior leaders of the community wouldn't do anything stupid  because they all know from their past experiences where a bad reaction could take things. But can they control a few overzealous youths? And that's what started this whole thing . It takes two to tango but we should all think what would one minority community do when you push them to the wall, do you not expect them to stand up for themselves? And when they do, the narrative is always ready at hand '"told you so, this is what they do". The media is absolutely corrupt in this country, which is another very important factor. One would think, who is actually reporting the other side of the story? Where is the level playing field? The Mumbai-Jaipur train killings; where is the media reporting the correct facts so that the right opinions could be formed. Do we really think Hindu Muslim Riots are new to this country? What has changed - it's how news is being reported and how social media has given a medium to a regular person to say or spread whatever version of the truth they want?
I don't understand what we expect Muslims and other minorities to do? You are attacking where they worship, where they work, where they travel, where they live and who they do business with. At some point someone will retaliate or pick up arms. What the fuck happened to our tolerance and inclusiveness we are known for? One guy's ego can't be bigger than the country. Why are we playing into his hands?

Stop looking at it as left and right. If person of x community attacks person of y community for community based reasons then right wing of y community will have right views of things where right wing of x will try to justify the action. Anti x left won't have the correct view on situation but honest left who will have much more correct view. Trying to find the middle place might not lead to correct opinion.
And generally if someone is trying to blame the victims or going whatabout then they are in the wrong side by default because if they were unbiased they would be able to admit something wrong happened and justice needs to happen.

[–]jituthesat 6 points7 points8 points 8 days ago (3 children)
The reason is a difference in normative orientations. Broadly speaking, the right wing groups (at least in India) believe in reprisals and group responsibility. Thus, if certain people of one community attack/provoke certain members of another community, the right wing thinks all members of the latter community have a right to retaliate against all members of the former community (without any requirement to show individual responsibility). In addition, the retaliations/reprisals don't have to be proportionate. Left Wing groups don't accept this principle of group responsibility/reprisals (at least in terms of actual violence though they endorse it somewhat in the incitement context). The reason both groups view things differently is because they have fundamentally different ideas about the culpability of the broader community for actions commited by individual members.

[–]fenrir245 1 point2 points3 points 8 days ago (1 child)

And there are so many of those provoking rallies taken by muslims on their festivals but only on hindu rallies the people get hurt. How so?

[–]Asewa-kun[🍰] 2 points3 points4 points 8 days ago (10 children)
During muhurram last year in Many places muslims were shouting death threats to hindus and brandishing swords .
If the police is letting the criminal go free then it's a problem on their part. Why should innocent hindus who attended the rally be killed by muslims just because the criminal was said to attend the rally.
Also the muslims should should not take the justice by killing the so called criminal but let the Justice system take care of it as they too are citizens of India.

[–]fenrir245 1 point2 points3 points 8 days ago (9 children)
And all those muslims were arrested promptly and the situation de-escalated by the police.
Meanwhile a literal murderer is going about threatening people and nothing is being done about it. The rally was literally unauthorised, and yet it went through with no pushback.
Are you claiming you won’t do anything if you see a mob armed with guns and swords heading towards your home?
Also the muslims should should not take the justice by killing the so called criminal but let the Justice system take care of it as they too are citizens of India.

If he is not caught that is police incompetence.
Almost all rallies in india are unauthorized even muslims ones too. So you can't blame anyone here.
Also the attack on hindu procession was pre planned in anticipation of monu mansear. The Muslims knew what route the procession would go as it was done every year.
There is no need to be shocked and attack the yatra and hindus.
What is the proof that justice system helped criminals. Atmost it is police incompetence. Also are u suggesting that muslims should kill innocent hindus to get their justice on one criminal. Nobody should take matters to their own hands and try to deliver justice.

Ah yes, compare an armed mob with baraats. Great logic.

If muslims can have swords during their religious processions why not hindus. Also the so called known murderer was not present at the rally. Also muslims started the violence first.

Swords and guns aren’t part of any hindu religious procession. Especially not the annual nuh procession.
You want to emulate islamists then do it yourself. Don’t try to drag in hindus with your nonsense.

And no one justified muslim violence, though I guess at this point it’s clear you don’t actually care what anyone is saying.
You clearly are unable to acknowledge the fact that muslims were first to attack hindus and hindus retaliated  against them. Both of these are not correct as justice should be given by courts not people.

It was a known fact that the procession was a yearly affair and had always been a quiet affair. On this occasion there was undue provocation by VHP by allowing that Monu guy to say he will join the rally. Authorities knew about this, all politicians knew about this but no one cared to stop him or convince him not to come. I am not saying he cannot come to attend a rally but if everyone knew this was a provocation then the responsible people should have taken preventive steps.

[–]Asewa-kun[🍰] 6 points7 points8 points 8 days ago (2 children)

[–]Brain_stoned 5 points6 points7 points 8 days ago (3 children)
I don't know much about this incident. So I asked 2 of my muslim friends from the office about it and they said it started when people found burnt bodies of 2 muslim guys in a cow vigilante's car. When I asked my hindu friend, he said that there was some violence that broke out between both the communities during some religious procession. One of my close friends came back to my city from gurgaon and he said that this is some huge spread of misinformation. So basically everyone has their own set of stories. We don't know what's true and what's not. Whatever it is, extremists from both sides are causing huge problems. With social media, it is easy to spread lies and incite people to create violence. Well, at the end of the day, the main culprits are politicians and religious leaders and it's the poor and middle class people that are suffering and losing their lives.

Let's say I post an article from indian news channel about some news that is against left they just say that it is propaganda, godi media and govt paid them... if a news channel like BBC says something against right wing and govt, they do not question whether it's propaganda and when someone points iit out they show the ranking of media houses and act superior about it and we can't criticise foreign media houses as they are telling truth.
When in reality all media houses are spreading news from certain narrative of their choice.

[–]Gameatro 1 point2 points3 points 8 days ago (2 children)
BBC is certainly more credible than most Indian media houses though. they definitely have bias but they are lot  better. Also people calling BBC propaganda don't have any proof about it whatsoever, while there is plenty of proof of media channels like Times Now doing propaganda for Modi

[–]Asewa-kun[🍰] -1 points0 points1 point 8 days ago (1 child)
BBC pushes a certain narrative about the news. For example in recent nuh clashes where the perpetrators were muslims and large no. Of people killed were hindus, they published a news article whose headline only tells that muslims were killed in india not that the victims were on both sides. They tell you half-truths to push their narrative. Another example I observed is that whenever india achieves something good, they mention south asia instead of India and when they report about something bad like minority persecution they specifically mention india whereas south asia has minority persecution some worse than india. All their news about india has been on this model. I dont know if BBC is really unbiased  in their reporting all around the world but when it concerns india they too like many media houses both at home and foreign have narrative of their choice and are not unbiased at all.

Really so it's ok to demonize saying Jai shree Ram but when. The other side uses slogan and rams a truck in pedestrian that's just us being phobic right.

[–]Preet0024USI -2 points-1 points0 points 8 days ago (2 children)
It's not okay to demonise any religious slogan bro. I'm not supporting that statement.
My point is, there will always be a few people who will do idiotic things and the blame will fall on the religion.

[+]Bournvitta2022 4 points5 points6 points 8 days ago (1 child)
When religious text explicitly ask to kill and do other hair to non believers it's the religion that has to take the blame.
Ambedkar was right abt this shit.

[–]fenrir245 0 points1 point2 points 8 days ago (0 children)
Ambedkar also spoke very choice words about the religion you champion.
But somehow that never registers.

Just speaks more about you that terrorists screaming “jai shree ram” isn’t demonising it, but people calling it out is.

Just like the Aryans who migrated to India and converted everyone to a foreign religion. Got it.

What's you proof that Aryan invasion happened ?? Whats the evidence that can be verified?

Did I say invasion, it was Aryan migration dummy.

Again name calling and no proof seriously.
For you people all civilization comes from whites and that's it.
As if africa has no part to play Asia as no part to play.

[–]VayuAir 1 point2 points3 points 8 days ago (0 children)
So you are an African then since all humans came from Africa. Meaning all Indians in India are foreigners.
Thanks for the confirmation.
(BTW Aryans came from Central Asia not Europe dummy)
You probably think Bournvitta is healthy, lol.

[–]AlanVanHalen -3 points-2 points-1 points 8 days ago (4 children)
Are you underhandedly talking about the Aryan people who invaded the Indian subcontinent, set up their new religion of Hinduism (which apparently was known as Sanatan Dharma back then 🤷🏻‍♂️) and divided society in multiple castes and deeming indigenous population as untouchables and also stole other religion's places of worship, most notably of Buddhism.
And they used to send their kids to religious schools under a Hindu priest where casteism was followed as holy decree.
Don't you think it's pretty old stuff now, albeit of it all being followed still. Or wait... Are you talking about those OTHER people? 👀🤔 Don't know why you're being downvoted, but yeah fuck them too.

[+]Bournvitta2022 2 points3 points4 points 8 days ago (3 children)
That theory has been debunked so many times. Just read some history that's not written by your leftist white boot lickers.
There was no Aryan invasion. Just read what all the traveller have written for centuries.
Seriously we are a civilization that has no connection to Aryan what a load of crap. Nazis used to believe in this Aryan shit  are you supporting them.
Read the texts written Mughal writter who served in the courts of aurangzeb and Akbar etc they have glorified the murder and pillage of Hindu society.
Open your eyes. Just read abt Gandhi for once and his famous experiment with celibacy. He was a great man .

What better alternative would you suggest for this? Anyone from your right wing dirty brown ass licker perhaps?
Anyway,
There was no Aryan invasion. Just read what all the traveller have written for centuries.
Don't know what theory you're blabbering about here, cuz I for one haven't mentioned any. I am only talking about the ethnic group that later be known as Indo-Aryans, that originally hails from the Western Asia/Eastern Europe and they came barging in the subcontinent of India and settled here, disrupting the native life here, imposing their religion to the people here and dividing it in various classes based on supposed caste. These are all historical facts, you can find them everywhere. Just skip those right winged propaganda texts, they obviously don't like to include such facts.
Also, if you have a problem with proper English words like Invasion as apparently it triggers you about whatever theory you're referring to, then sure I can use some appropriate synonyms, no problem. Would you accept expropriation? Or I'll do you one better with a phrase... a mild slow incursion, that certainly should do it.
Nazis used to believe in this Aryan shit are you supporting them.
That's a strong accusation coming from someone who supports a neo-Nazi regime whose principles are based on Nazism, down to even iconography.
Read the texts written Mughal writter who served in the courts of aurangzeb and Akbar etc they have glorified the murder and pillage of Hindu society.
You're missing a few words here and there in the above statement, but I do agree with what you said, no denying that. Hindu rulers have massacred Muslims, Muslim rulers have pillaged Hindus. It's an unfortunate vicious cycle. Even happening everywhere here. I wonder if both sides think that it's a good population control medium 🤷🏻‍♂️
Open your eyes. Just read abt Gandhi for once and his famous experiment with celibacy. He was a great man .

That's a high praise coming from a closeted Chaddi.

[–]Archer_Arjun -1 points0 points1 point 8 days ago (1 child)
Chaddi's perception  - Since we used to rule the country , only we should rule the country and disrespect religion with 15% population .
Jihadi's perception  - Since opponents want to convert us , we should fight against them in conversion .
Unless we fix both extremist gangs we wont be able to bring peace in this country.

The State should have the monopoly on violence. This is a law and order breakdown

[–]highontears -1 points0 points1 point 8 days ago (0 children)
Right wing tries very hard to deny that minorities are under threat in India under Hindutva mentality. They instead feel that Hindus have always been the victims and secularism is a burden. They virtually turn a blind eye to anything that suggests that their ideology may be leading to deaths , or do whataboutery like in the case of manipur. So whenever in a riot , which is most likely orchestrated by bjp themself , there are hindu victims then they make sure to shout about it for days. Whoever started the riots does not matter, point is that law and order should be demanded from the state. Which the liberals do. But right wing tries to use their deaths to further their poisonous agenda. Instead of wondering why this happened in a bjp double engine govt, they encourage people to believe that this would be worse without bjp. They have fallen to such low levels that yesterday in Twitter some fake news obscure YouTube channels staged a drama where torn clothes of women were shown near the temple in Nuh. It was quickly busted when security officials denied any reports of rape or missing people.

Does the truth lie in between?
It might lie in between, one side can be right or sometimes nothing actually happened or sometimes something happened but whatever happened is completely unrelated.
I know, I am biased myself and try to read opposite views to try reduce bias.
Rather than rely on views (views does not have to be based on facts), to know the truth you need to find complete facts which is always difficult, sometimes impossible to find. Even facts can be a lie if it is incomplete.
Social media for example give us views with incomplete facts that support the view or sometimes complete lack of facts.

You're an idiot if you believe in this LW vs RW argument to start with.
There is always only 1 administration. They are the ones responsible for maintaining peace. After any incident, first question should be asked at them.
Why could they not prevent the violence?
Why could they not control the violence?
Why did they not see the signs of upcoming violence?
Where were their people during this violence?

That's because the digital era finally became toxic to the general masses when it started data targeting for polarisation, leading to people defining their personalities and identities via ideologies and political beliefs.
We are now in times when you don't base your opinions based on the news, you select the news based on your opinions.
I did an experiment a while back when I had two phones. I created a new Google ID, IG ID, Reddit, and YT. I made sure that phone was never on wifi and I didn't login on my main accounts on it. I began by searching only Left wing, anti-Hindu, pro-Muslim, somewhat anti-India content on it and only the opposite, i.e., right wing, pro-Hindu, anti-Muslim, nationalistic content on it. It took barely 3-4 days when the suggestion feed on all platforms in both of my phones including the news were totally opposite and different. Reddit only suggested usi, rndia, YT started suggesting me Dhruv Rathee videos, the news feed on YT started coming from left leaning journalism agencies.
And on my main phone, the scenario was completely opposite.
This went on for 6 month, then I sold my other phone.
Some of my learnings from this, not just about left vs right:
Overall, it's not just that most of the time, it's something always in the middle, but more often than not, to see the middle, you have to let go of both sides and just see a thing for what it is. Whatever's happening, it has less to do with BJP vs Anti-BJP, and more to do with people reacting out of hatred and disgust for the other side.
Things I found were right about one side and wrong about the other:
Listening to the other side and trying to understand it always helps in the long run.
No one just woke up one day and started to hate on someone just because he's from the opposite side.
There are some things they've learnt and know, there are some things you know.
This comment isn't about unity, that's a pipe dream, which happens for a few days every decade. It's more about choosing to do your own learning and research than listening to what an echo chamber and its icons want you to know. All the right and left wing subs (usi, rndia, rndiaspeaks, rndianews, Samsharmashow) are echo chambers stuck in a loop, and even the subs which call themselves neutral (rndiadiscussion) are biased af

Truth is complex and multi-faceted but political lobbying either tries to oversimplify it or overcomplicate it as per their agenda.
Reconciling left and right wing is impossible in any meaningful or sustained manner. Centrism is a passive observer position that is acceptable because most people shouldn't try to get involved in politics without knowing all the facts. That's a recipe for disaster but it happens way too often.
I don't know about left or right but I see liberals and conservatives constantly deriding each other on Indian social media and even American social media.
National level power is coveted by both.
The reason for coveting power is sometimes not power for its own sake, but because the policies of one side can be so detrimental to the other that they have no choice but to become political about it. The issue of large scale social injustices like the ones in Manipur crops up. The story is similar since human civilization organized themselves into political groups based on common shared identity of skin color, social class, profession, vision for future, pride of their heritage and legacy etc
People who have prospered in a certain way of life, either liberal or conservative, and observed the excesses of the other one, tend to think all instances of the other one are bad. The truth is usually more nuanced.
Individually a person might have shades of both. He or she might be conservative in some aspects, and liberal in others.
Reducing bias in political discourse is always hard due to two reasons: greed for power and blind eye to social injustices happening on the ground.

I have a very old habit of reading newspaper early in the morning. Lately what I have been doing is to read a pro and an anti government paper. The differential take on the same event gives me a balanced perspective. That has been working so far.

When the government and the media it controls are hellbent on hiding the information, busy demonising a particular group and bending over backwards to protect criminals, of course it becomes hard to get at the truth.
But many people actually want this, so that’s where you want to start the “unity”.

[–]fatherofgodfather 0 points1 point2 points 8 days ago (0 children)
This is the wrong question imo. The only questions should be what are the facts? And what is the right response to it if you had been a victim. Mostly the right answers will be on the left. That's because reality itself has a left wing bias. You cannot be denying reality.

Let me tell you something.
Seeking Truth as an absolute is a futile endeavour.
Truth is always subjective and only thing that can never be disputed is facts ....and fact,my friend, lies under the Vail of truth which is subjective so you have your catch 22 on hands and ....
Tldr: you are expecting to know absolute truth you are either too naive or to dumb to understand the nature of it
