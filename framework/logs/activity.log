Case 2: You’ve not filed your GSTR-1 in GST portal
In case you had accidentally marked your return as filed without filing your return in the GST portal, you have the option to unfile it.

In case you need to edit a transaction that you’ve included in your GSTR-1 filing that has been filed directly through Zoho Books, you can unfile your GSTR-1 return.
If you need to unfile a return that is not the recent GSTR-1 filing, you need to unfile all GSTR-1 returns from the most recent filing in reverse sequential order until you reach the return you want to unfile.
Note: Unfiling the GSTR-1 return that has been filed directly through Zoho Books will not unfile the return in the GST Portal.
Note: Any changes you make to transactions after unfiling your GSTR-1 return should be manually amended when you file your future returns.

Write a concise summary of the following text; include any information that can be used to answer the question "How to file the GSTR1". Do not directly answer the question itself:


LITERAL TEXT: """



File GSTR-1
GSTR-1 is a tax return that has to be filed by a regular dealer on the GSTN portal. If you are a regular dealer, then you have to upload the details of all your outward supplies (or sales transactions) every month or quarter, as per the turnover from the previous Financial Year.
Filing your return might sound like a daunting task, but TallyPrime will make your journey as easy as possible, while taking care of your business practices and preferences. You can file your GSTR-1 using TallyPrime in the following three ways.
Generate JSON file using TallyPrime and upload on the portal
This method fits in perfectly with the regular course of your business. You only have to record your GST transactions in TallyPrime, as usual, and the relevant details will be reflected seamlessly in the GSTR-1 report in TallyPrime. After that, you can export the details to a JSON file and upload it to the portal. As easy as that! All your GST data from TallyPrime will appear seamlessly on the portal.
Generate JSON file using GST Offline Tool and upload on the portal
Instead of directly generating a JSON file from TallyPrime, you can also make use of the GST Offline Tool provided by the portal. In this method, you have to export your GSTR-1 details from TallyPrime in the MS Excel or CSV format, and then import the file into the GST Offline Tool. Then you can export the details to a JSON file and upload it to the portal.
File GSTR-1 directly on the portal
If you do not wish to file your return using a JSON file, then you can also file your GSTR-1 directly on the portal. In this method, you can easily copy the details from the GSTR-1 report in TallyPrime and paste it in the respective sections on the portal. Alternatively, you can also fill the details manually by referring to the values in TallyPrime.
Prerequisites for Filing GSTR-1
Before proceeding to file GSTR-1, you must take care of a few requirements to ensure that your filing goes as smoothly as possible.
System requirements
General GST requirements
Requirements in tax liability on advance receipts

Generate JSON File Using TallyPrime
Once you have verified your GSTR-1, you can easily share these details with the tax department. You only have to export the details in the required format and upload it on the portal. All your GST data from TallyPrime will appear seamlessly on the portal.

The exported file will be saved in the selected Folder Path, which will be automatically opened by TallyPrime. Now you can proceed to upload the file on the GST portal.
Uploading GSTR-1 when HSN Summary has negative quantity
If the HSN Summary contains a negative quantity, then you might face problems in uploading the JSON file on the GST portal. Until this issue is resolved by GSTN, you can perform the following steps for a successful upload.
I. Update the details in the JSON file
II. Update the details on the portal
File GSTR-1 Return
If you have generated multiple JSON files for uploading your latest transactions and for deleting some of your previous transactions, then it is recommended that you first upload the JSON file for deleting the transactions, and then upload the JSON file for regular transactions. This will ensure that all your details are uploaded and processed seamlessly.
Here is an animated GIF to show you how you can easily file GSTR-1 on the portal using the JSON files generated from TallyPrime:

Generate JSON File Using GST Offline Tool
Once you have downloaded and installed the GST Offline Tool, you can import the MS Excel or CSV files generated from TallyPrime.
The department has released GST Offline Tool Version 3.1.6. To know about the changes needed to generate the JSON file in this version, refer to the Changes when using the GST Offline Tool Version 3.1.6 section. Before importing your MS Excel and CSV files to the GST Offline Tool, you have to make the following changes in the files:
1. In the B2B and CDNR sheets, update the invoice type from Regular to Regular B2B.
2. Update the HSN codes to include at least two digits, based on the annual turnover of your business
Export GSTR-1 to MS Excel or CSV files
The exported file will be saved in the selected Folder Path, which will be automatically opened by TallyPrime. If you have selected the Excel (Spreadsheet) format, TallyPrime will create a single MS Excel file. For CSV format, TallyPrime will create separate CSV files for each table in GSTR-1. These files have to be imported into the GST Offline Tool.
If the $ symbol appears in the data exported to MS Excel, generate your data in the CSV format. However, if you want to continue in the MS Excel format, then you have to go to the Trust Center Settings in MS Excel and add the location where TallyPrime is installed on your computer.
For more details on the information captured in each column of the e-Return template, click here.
Import data and generate the JSON file
Ensure that you download and install the latest version of the GST Offline Tool. The department has released GSTR Offline Tool Version 3.1.6. When using this version of the tool, complete these steps for importing data, and do a couple of simple changes as mentioned under Changes when using the GST Offline Tool Version 3.1.6.
If you are using Version 3.1.6 of the GST Offline Tool, all the sections, except B2B and CDNR, will get imported. To know how to import these sheets, refer to the Changes when using the GST Offline Tool Version 3.1.6 section.
To import the return details in the CSV format, select the name of the table in Select Section under Import Returns – One section at a time, and click Import CSV. You have to individually import files for each section.
If you get a warning that some invoices contain invalid input, you can ignore it and proceed to generate the file. This can happen when you do not have any transactions in a selected section.
The GST Offline Tool generates a JSON file that has to be uploaded on the GST portal. If you are using Version 3.1.6 of the GST Offline Tool, then you have to perform the following steps to generate the JSON file.
Updates needed while using Version 3.1.6 of the GST Offline Tool
Now you can log in to the GST portal and file your GSTR-1 returns.
Updates needed for e-commerce operators
The GST department has not issued any GSTIN/UIN for e-commerce operators. Thereby, when GST data is exported from TallyPrime to MS Excel or CSV files, the GSTIN/UIN entered in the e-commerce party ledger is captured as E-Commerce GSTIN in b2b, b2cl, and b2cs worksheets.
You have to make the following updates after exporting data to MS Excel or CSV files:
File GSTR-1 Directly on GST Portal
Download and install the GST Offline Tool
Uninstall the previous version of GST Offline Tool
If you are using an older version of the GST Offline Tool, then it is recommended that you uninstall it and use the latest version.
Now you can download and install the latest version of the GST Offline Tool.
Depending on your requirements, you can use the GST Offline Tool either on the same computer where TallyPrime is installed, or on a different computer.
Mapping the Unit of Measurement (UoM) when the UQC is not available
The list of Unit Quantity Codes (UQC) provided by the department does not have the representative code for units such as brass, carats, and running foot. However, you can resolve this issue in TallyPrime using the following steps.

The e-Return file has the provision to capture the taxable value and tax rate but not the tax amount. Hence, the tax amount is not exported to the e-Return file. After the details are uploaded, the tax value is automatically calculated based on the rate, taxable value, and place of supply.
Filing GSTR-1 for QRMP Dealers
If you have opted for the QRMP scheme, then you will have to upload B2B invoices and credit notes every month using the Invoice Furnishing Facility (IFF) provision on the GST portal. Accordingly, TallyPrime provides you with the facility to export the JSON files of each section in GSTR-1. Refer to the Uploading to IFF for QRMP Dealers topic for more details.

However, the turnover value will be editable and you will have the option to amend it. 13. What does the ‘Total Invoice Value’ column indicate in Form GSTR-1?

Write a concise summary of the following text; include any information that can be used to answer the question "How to file the GSTR1". Do not directly answer the question itself:


LITERAL TEXT: """



File GSTR-1
GSTR-1 is a tax return that has to be filed by a regular dealer on the GSTN portal. If you are a regular dealer, then you have to upload the details of all your outward supplies (or sales transactions) every month or quarter, as per the turnover from the previous Financial Year.
Filing your return might sound like a daunting task, but TallyPrime will make your journey as easy as possible, while taking care of your business practices and preferences. You can file your GSTR-1 using TallyPrime in the following three ways.
Generate JSON file using TallyPrime and upload on the portal
This method fits in perfectly with the regular course of your business. You only have to record your GST transactions in TallyPrime, as usual, and the relevant details will be reflected seamlessly in the GSTR-1 report in TallyPrime. After that, you can export the details to a JSON file and upload it to the portal. As easy as that! All your GST data from TallyPrime will appear seamlessly on the portal.
Generate JSON file using GST Offline Tool and upload on the portal
Instead of directly generating a JSON file from TallyPrime, you can also make use of the GST Offline Tool provided by the portal. In this method, you have to export your GSTR-1 details from TallyPrime in the MS Excel or CSV format, and then import the file into the GST Offline Tool. Then you can export the details to a JSON file and upload it to the portal.
File GSTR-1 directly on the portal
If you do not wish to file your return using a JSON file, then you can also file your GSTR-1 directly on the portal. In this method, you can easily copy the details from the GSTR-1 report in TallyPrime and paste it in the respective sections on the portal. Alternatively, you can also fill the details manually by referring to the values in TallyPrime.
Prerequisites for Filing GSTR-1
Before proceeding to file GSTR-1, you must take care of a few requirements to ensure that your filing goes as smoothly as possible.
System requirements
General GST requirements
Requirements in tax liability on advance receipts

Generate JSON File Using TallyPrime
Once you have verified your GSTR-1, you can easily share these details with the tax department. You only have to export the details in the required format and upload it on the portal. All your GST data from TallyPrime will appear seamlessly on the portal.

The exported file will be saved in the selected Folder Path, which will be automatically opened by TallyPrime. Now you can proceed to upload the file on the GST portal.
Uploading GSTR-1 when HSN Summary has negative quantity
If the HSN Summary contains a negative quantity, then you might face problems in uploading the JSON file on the GST portal. Until this issue is resolved by GSTN, you can perform the following steps for a successful upload.
I. Update the details in the JSON file
II. Update the details on the portal
File GSTR-1 Return
If you have generated multiple JSON files for uploading your latest transactions and for deleting some of your previous transactions, then it is recommended that you first upload the JSON file for deleting the transactions, and then upload the JSON file for regular transactions. This will ensure that all your details are uploaded and processed seamlessly.
Here is an animated GIF to show you how you can easily file GSTR-1 on the portal using the JSON files generated from TallyPrime:

Generate JSON File Using GST Offline Tool
Once you have downloaded and installed the GST Offline Tool, you can import the MS Excel or CSV files generated from TallyPrime.
The department has released GST Offline Tool Version 3.1.6. To know about the changes needed to generate the JSON file in this version, refer to the Changes when using the GST Offline Tool Version 3.1.6 section. Before importing your MS Excel and CSV files to the GST Offline Tool, you have to make the following changes in the files:
1. In the B2B and CDNR sheets, update the invoice type from Regular to Regular B2B.
2. Update the HSN codes to include at least two digits, based on the annual turnover of your business
Export GSTR-1 to MS Excel or CSV files
The exported file will be saved in the selected Folder Path, which will be automatically opened by TallyPrime. If you have selected the Excel (Spreadsheet) format, TallyPrime will create a single MS Excel file. For CSV format, TallyPrime will create separate CSV files for each table in GSTR-1. These files have to be imported into the GST Offline Tool.
If the $ symbol appears in the data exported to MS Excel, generate your data in the CSV format. However, if you want to continue in the MS Excel format, then you have to go to the Trust Center Settings in MS Excel and add the location where TallyPrime is installed on your computer.
For more details on the information captured in each column of the e-Return template, click here.
Import data and generate the JSON file
Ensure that you download and install the latest version of the GST Offline Tool. The department has released GSTR Offline Tool Version 3.1.6. When using this version of the tool, complete these steps for importing data, and do a couple of simple changes as mentioned under Changes when using the GST Offline Tool Version 3.1.6.
If you are using Version 3.1.6 of the GST Offline Tool, all the sections, except B2B and CDNR, will get imported. To know how to import these sheets, refer to the Changes when using the GST Offline Tool Version 3.1.6 section.
To import the return details in the CSV format, select the name of the table in Select Section under Import Returns – One section at a time, and click Import CSV. You have to individually import files for each section.
If you get a warning that some invoices contain invalid input, you can ignore it and proceed to generate the file. This can happen when you do not have any transactions in a selected section.
The GST Offline Tool generates a JSON file that has to be uploaded on the GST portal. If you are using Version 3.1.6 of the GST Offline Tool, then you have to perform the following steps to generate the JSON file.
Updates needed while using Version 3.1.6 of the GST Offline Tool
Now you can log in to the GST portal and file your GSTR-1 returns.
Updates needed for e-commerce operators
The GST department has not issued any GSTIN/UIN for e-commerce operators. Thereby, when GST data is exported from TallyPrime to MS Excel or CSV files, the GSTIN/UIN entered in the e-commerce party ledger is captured as E-Commerce GSTIN in b2b, b2cl, and b2cs worksheets.
You have to make the following updates after exporting data to MS Excel or CSV files:
File GSTR-1 Directly on GST Portal
Download and install the GST Offline Tool
Uninstall the previous version of GST Offline Tool
If you are using an older version of the GST Offline Tool, then it is recommended that you uninstall it and use the latest version.
Now you can download and install the latest version of the GST Offline Tool.
Depending on your requirements, you can use the GST Offline Tool either on the same computer where TallyPrime is installed, or on a different computer.
Mapping the Unit of Measurement (UoM) when the UQC is not available
The list of Unit Quantity Codes (UQC) provided by the department does not have the representative code for units such as brass, carats, and running foot. However, you can resolve this issue in TallyPrime using the following steps.

The e-Return file has the provision to capture the taxable value and tax rate but not the tax amount. Hence, the tax amount is not exported to the e-Return file. After the details are uploaded, the tax value is automatically calculated based on the rate, taxable value, and place of supply.
Filing GSTR-1 for QRMP Dealers
If you have opted for the QRMP scheme, then you will have to upload B2B invoices and credit notes every month using the Invoice Furnishing Facility (IFF) provision on the GST portal. Accordingly, TallyPrime provides you with the facility to export the JSON files of each section in GSTR-1. Refer to the Uploading to IFF for QRMP Dealers topic for more details.

Basics of GSTR-1
What is GSTR-1?
GSTR-1 is a monthly or quarterly return that should be filed by every registered GST taxpayer, except a few as given in further sections. It contains details of all outward supplies i.e sales. The return has a total of 13 sections, listed down as follows:
When is GSTR-1 due?
The due dates for GSTR-1 are based on your aggregate turnover. Businesses with sales of up to Rs.5 crore have an option to file quarterly returns under the QRMP scheme and are due by the 13th of the month following the relevant quarter.
Whereas, those taxpayers who do not opt for the QRMP scheme or have a total turnover above Rs.5 crore must file the return every month on or before the 11th of the next month.
Who should file GSTR-1?
Every registered person is required to file GSTR-1 irrespective of whether there are any transactions during the period or not. For nil GSTR-1 filers, there is a facility to file through an SMS that began from the 1st week of July 2020. The following registered persons are not required to file GSTR-1:
How to revise GSTR-1?
A return once filed cannot be revised under GST. Any mistake made in the return can be rectified in the GSTR-1 filed for the next period (month/quarter). It means that if a mistake is made in GSTR-1 of December 2022, rectification for the same can be made in the GSTR-1 of January 2023 or subsequent months.
Late Fees and Penalty
The following table explains the late fee to be charged (for other than nil GSTR-1 filing cases):
The following table explains the late fee to be charged in case of nil GSTR-1 filing:
The original late fees used to be Rs.100 per day under each CGST Act and respective SGST/ UTGST Act.

Frequently Asked Questions on GSTR-1
Yes, filing GSTR 1 is mandatory even if there were no sales during a month/quarter. In this case, you have to file Nil GSTR-1.
You can upload invoices anytime. It is highly advised that you upload invoices at regular intervals during the month to avoid bulk upload at the time of filing a return. This is because bulk upload takes a lot of time.
After uploading bills you can make changes multiple times. There is no restriction on changing invoices after uploading them. But you can change an invoice only before submitting a return. Once submitted, the numbers are frozen.
Yes, you can file the GSTR-1 even after the due date. However, you have to pay a late fee based on the delayed number of days.
You have to report all the sales detail in GSTR-1, whereas you have to report summarised figures of sales, ITC claimed, and net tax payable in GSTR-3B return.
No, with effect from 1st January 2022, you have to file GSTR-1 before filing the GSTR-3B return.
You should not file GSTR-1. However, you have to use Form CMP-08 to make tax payments on a quarterly basis.
GSTR-1 is a return where details of sales are filed with the government. Hence, there is no need to pay tax after filing this return. However, you have to pay the tax due while filing GSTR-3B.
You need to continue filing GSTR-1 on a quarterly basis and the GSTR-3B will also need to be filed on a quarterly basis with monthly tax payments. For more information about the QRMP scheme, read our article on “All about the QRMP scheme.”
You can upload the invoices related to the first two months of the quarter using the Invoice Furnishing Facility (IFF) and last month’s invoices in the quarterly GSTR-1. Click here to read more about IFF.
Yes, you can make amendments to an already filed GSTR-1 of a particular tax period by declaring the amended details in the return.For example, Mr X of Kerala has sold goods to Mr Y of Karnataka for Rs. 1,00,000 on 30th December 2022 and declared in the GSTR-1 of December 2022. Now he realised that he made a mistake in the date of the invoice, so he can make an amended invoice with the correct invoice date i.e., 16th December 2022. This amended invoice can be shown in the GSTR-1 of January 2023.
The ‘Revised date’ to be mentioned in an amended invoice must be not later than the last date of the original invoice tax period.For example, if an original invoice dated 12th December 2022 is being amended in January 2023 then the revised invoice date cannot be later than 31st December 2022.
The following details cannot be amended at Invoice level :
Note: However, you can replace the existing place of supply with another place of supply with some limitations. Refer to the examples given below.
With respect to Place of Supply, note the following:
Let us understand the above with the following scenarios:
We can see that in all those cases where the original place of supply was amended from Kerala to Karnataka (whether or not there was a change in tax rates or invoicing), the amendment is allowed.But in the last case where in addition to Kerala, Karnataka is also added as a place of supply (irrespective of change in tax rates or invoicing) amendment does not hold good
Declare the amended invoices or details in the tax period in which the amendment takes place as follows:

File GSTR-1
GSTR-1 is a tax return that has to be filed by a regular dealer on the GSTN portal. If you are a regular dealer, then you have to upload the details of all your outward supplies (or sales transactions) every month or quarter, as per the turnover from the previous Financial Year.
Filing your return might sound like a daunting task, but TallyPrime will make your journey as easy as possible, while taking care of your business practices and preferences. You can file your GSTR-1 using TallyPrime in the following three ways.
Generate JSON file using TallyPrime and upload on the portal
This method fits in perfectly with the regular course of your business. You only have to record your GST transactions in TallyPrime, as usual, and the relevant details will be reflected seamlessly in the GSTR-1 report in TallyPrime. After that, you can export the details to a JSON file and upload it to the portal. As easy as that! All your GST data from TallyPrime will appear seamlessly on the portal.
Generate JSON file using GST Offline Tool and upload on the portal
Instead of directly generating a JSON file from TallyPrime, you can also make use of the GST Offline Tool provided by the portal. In this method, you have to export your GSTR-1 details from TallyPrime in the MS Excel or CSV format, and then import the file into the GST Offline Tool. Then you can export the details to a JSON file and upload it to the portal.
File GSTR-1 directly on the portal
If you do not wish to file your return using a JSON file, then you can also file your GSTR-1 directly on the portal. In this method, you can easily copy the details from the GSTR-1 report in TallyPrime and paste it in the respective sections on the portal. Alternatively, you can also fill the details manually by referring to the values in TallyPrime.
Prerequisites for Filing GSTR-1
Before proceeding to file GSTR-1, you must take care of a few requirements to ensure that your filing goes as smoothly as possible.
System requirements
General GST requirements
Requirements in tax liability on advance receipts

Generate JSON File Using TallyPrime
Once you have verified your GSTR-1, you can easily share these details with the tax department. You only have to export the details in the required format and upload it on the portal. All your GST data from TallyPrime will appear seamlessly on the portal.

The exported file will be saved in the selected Folder Path, which will be automatically opened by TallyPrime. Now you can proceed to upload the file on the GST portal.
Uploading GSTR-1 when HSN Summary has negative quantity
If the HSN Summary contains a negative quantity, then you might face problems in uploading the JSON file on the GST portal. Until this issue is resolved by GSTN, you can perform the following steps for a successful upload.
I. Update the details in the JSON file
II. Update the details on the portal
File GSTR-1 Return
If you have generated multiple JSON files for uploading your latest transactions and for deleting some of your previous transactions, then it is recommended that you first upload the JSON file for deleting the transactions, and then upload the JSON file for regular transactions. This will ensure that all your details are uploaded and processed seamlessly.
Here is an animated GIF to show you how you can easily file GSTR-1 on the portal using the JSON files generated from TallyPrime:

Generate JSON File Using GST Offline Tool
Once you have downloaded and installed the GST Offline Tool, you can import the MS Excel or CSV files generated from TallyPrime.
The department has released GST Offline Tool Version 3.1.6. To know about the changes needed to generate the JSON file in this version, refer to the Changes when using the GST Offline Tool Version 3.1.6 section. Before importing your MS Excel and CSV files to the GST Offline Tool, you have to make the following changes in the files:
1. In the B2B and CDNR sheets, update the invoice type from Regular to Regular B2B.
2. Update the HSN codes to include at least two digits, based on the annual turnover of your business
Export GSTR-1 to MS Excel or CSV files
The exported file will be saved in the selected Folder Path, which will be automatically opened by TallyPrime. If you have selected the Excel (Spreadsheet) format, TallyPrime will create a single MS Excel file. For CSV format, TallyPrime will create separate CSV files for each table in GSTR-1. These files have to be imported into the GST Offline Tool.
If the $ symbol appears in the data exported to MS Excel, generate your data in the CSV format. However, if you want to continue in the MS Excel format, then you have to go to the Trust Center Settings in MS Excel and add the location where TallyPrime is installed on your computer.
For more details on the information captured in each column of the e-Return template, click here.
Import data and generate the JSON file
Ensure that you download and install the latest version of the GST Offline Tool. The department has released GSTR Offline Tool Version 3.1.6. When using this version of the tool, complete these steps for importing data, and do a couple of simple changes as mentioned under Changes when using the GST Offline Tool Version 3.1.6.
If you are using Version 3.1.6 of the GST Offline Tool, all the sections, except B2B and CDNR, will get imported. To know how to import these sheets, refer to the Changes when using the GST Offline Tool Version 3.1.6 section.
To import the return details in the CSV format, select the name of the table in Select Section under Import Returns – One section at a time, and click Import CSV. You have to individually import files for each section.
If you get a warning that some invoices contain invalid input, you can ignore it and proceed to generate the file. This can happen when you do not have any transactions in a selected section.
The GST Offline Tool generates a JSON file that has to be uploaded on the GST portal. If you are using Version 3.1.6 of the GST Offline Tool, then you have to perform the following steps to generate the JSON file.
Updates needed while using Version 3.1.6 of the GST Offline Tool
Now you can log in to the GST portal and file your GSTR-1 returns.
Updates needed for e-commerce operators
The GST department has not issued any GSTIN/UIN for e-commerce operators. Thereby, when GST data is exported from TallyPrime to MS Excel or CSV files, the GSTIN/UIN entered in the e-commerce party ledger is captured as E-Commerce GSTIN in b2b, b2cl, and b2cs worksheets.
You have to make the following updates after exporting data to MS Excel or CSV files:
File GSTR-1 Directly on GST Portal
Download and install the GST Offline Tool
Uninstall the previous version of GST Offline Tool
If you are using an older version of the GST Offline Tool, then it is recommended that you uninstall it and use the latest version.
Now you can download and install the latest version of the GST Offline Tool.
Depending on your requirements, you can use the GST Offline Tool either on the same computer where TallyPrime is installed, or on a different computer.

The e-Return file has the provision to capture the taxable value and tax rate but not the tax amount. Hence, the tax amount is not exported to the e-Return file. After the details are uploaded, the tax value is automatically calculated based on the rate, taxable value, and place of supply.
Filing GSTR-1 for QRMP Dealers
If you have opted for the QRMP scheme, then you will have to upload B2B invoices and credit notes every month using the Invoice Furnishing Facility (IFF) provision on the GST portal. Accordingly, TallyPrime provides you with the facility to export the JSON files of each section in GSTR-1. Refer to the Uploading to IFF for QRMP Dealers topic for more details.

Basics of GSTR-1
What is GSTR-1?
GSTR-1 is a monthly or quarterly return that should be filed by every registered GST taxpayer, except a few as given in further sections. It contains details of all outward supplies i.e sales. The return has a total of 13 sections, listed down as follows:
When is GSTR-1 due?
The due dates for GSTR-1 are based on your aggregate turnover. Businesses with sales of up to Rs.5 crore have an option to file quarterly returns under the QRMP scheme and are due by the 13th of the month following the relevant quarter.
Whereas, those taxpayers who do not opt for the QRMP scheme or have a total turnover above Rs.5 crore must file the return every month on or before the 11th of the next month.
Who should file GSTR-1?
Every registered person is required to file GSTR-1 irrespective of whether there are any transactions during the period or not. For nil GSTR-1 filers, there is a facility to file through an SMS that began from the 1st week of July 2020. The following registered persons are not required to file GSTR-1:
How to revise GSTR-1?
A return once filed cannot be revised under GST. Any mistake made in the return can be rectified in the GSTR-1 filed for the next period (month/quarter). It means that if a mistake is made in GSTR-1 of December 2022, rectification for the same can be made in the GSTR-1 of January 2023 or subsequent months.
Late Fees and Penalty
The following table explains the late fee to be charged (for other than nil GSTR-1 filing cases):
The following table explains the late fee to be charged in case of nil GSTR-1 filing:
The original late fees used to be Rs.100 per day under each CGST Act and respective SGST/ UTGST Act. Also, the original late fee for Nil return filers used to be Rs.25 per day under each CGST Act and respective SGST/ UTGST Act. However, CBIC has notified reduced late fees to provide relief for businesses having difficulties in GST return filing.Also, the CBIC issued notification 20/2021 dated 1st June 2021, to cap the maximum late fee chargeable from June 2021 onwards.

Frequently Asked Questions on GSTR-1
Yes, filing GSTR 1 is mandatory even if there were no sales during a month/quarter. In this case, you have to file Nil GSTR-1.
You can upload invoices anytime. It is highly advised that you upload invoices at regular intervals during the month to avoid bulk upload at the time of filing a return. This is because bulk upload takes a lot of time.
After uploading bills you can make changes multiple times. There is no restriction on changing invoices after uploading them. But you can change an invoice only before submitting a return. Once submitted, the numbers are frozen.
Yes, you can file the GSTR-1 even after the due date. However, you have to pay a late fee based on the delayed number of days.
You have to report all the sales detail in GSTR-1, whereas you have to report summarised figures of sales, ITC claimed, and net tax payable in GSTR-3B return.
No, with effect from 1st January 2022, you have to file GSTR-1 before filing the GSTR-3B return.
You should not file GSTR-1. However, you have to use Form CMP-08 to make tax payments on a quarterly basis.
GSTR-1 is a return where details of sales are filed with the government. Hence, there is no need to pay tax after filing this return. However, you have to pay the tax due while filing GSTR-3B.
You need to continue filing GSTR-1 on a quarterly basis and the GSTR-3B will also need to be filed on a quarterly basis with monthly tax payments. For more information about the QRMP scheme, read our article on “All about the QRMP scheme.”
You can upload the invoices related to the first two months of the quarter using the Invoice Furnishing Facility (IFF) and last month’s invoices in the quarterly GSTR-1. Click here to read more about IFF.
Yes, you can make amendments to an already filed GSTR-1 of a particular tax period by declaring the amended details in the return.For example, Mr X of Kerala has sold goods to Mr Y of Karnataka for Rs. 1,00,000 on 30th December 2022 and declared in the GSTR-1 of December 2022. Now he realised that he made a mistake in the date of the invoice, so he can make an amended invoice with the correct invoice date i.e., 16th December 2022. This amended invoice can be shown in the GSTR-1 of January 2023.
The ‘Revised date’ to be mentioned in an amended invoice must be not later than the last date of the original invoice tax period.For example, if an original invoice dated 12th December 2022 is being amended in January 2023 then the revised invoice date cannot be later than 31st December 2022.
The following details cannot be amended at Invoice level :
Note: However, you can replace the existing place of supply with another place of supply with some limitations. Refer to the examples given below.
With respect to Place of Supply, note the following:
Let us understand the above with the following scenarios:
We can see that in all those cases where the original place of supply was amended from Kerala to Karnataka (whether or not there was a change in tax rates or invoicing), the amendment is allowed.But in the last case where in addition to Kerala, Karnataka is also added as a place of supply (irrespective of change in tax rates or invoicing) amendment does not hold good
Declare the amended invoices or details in the tax period in which the amendment takes place as follows:

Summaries: Form GSTR-1 is a monthly/quarterly statement of outward supplies that needs to be filed by all normal and casual registered taxpayers who make outward supplies of goods and services. It contains details of these outward supplies and is filed electronically on the GST Portal. The form is mandatory to be filed even if there is no business activity during the tax period.

Taxpayers have the option to opt for quarterly filing of Form GSTR-1 if their turnover during the preceding financial year was up to Rs. 5 Crore or if they are registered during the current financial year and expect their aggregate turnover to be up to Rs. 5 Crores. If the quarterly filing option is chosen, both Form GSTR-1 and Form GSTR-3B need to be filed quarterly.

Once a taxpayer has opted for quarterly filing, they cannot change their preference unless they have not filed any return during the financial year according to the original frequency.

Form GSTR-1 can be prepared using three modes: online entry on the GST Portal, uploading of invoice and other data using the Returns Offline Tool, or using third-party applications provided by Application Software Providers (ASPs) through GST Suvidha Providers (GSPs).

The form requires various details to be furnished, including invoice level details of supplies to registered persons, inter-state supplies of invoice value greater than Rs. 2,50,000 to unregistered persons, details of credit/debit notes issued, details of export of goods and services, summarized state-level details of supplies to unregistered persons, details of advances received in relation to future supply, and more.

There are certain types of registered taxpayers who are not required to file Form GSTR-1, including taxpayers under the Composition Scheme, non-resident foreign taxpayers, online information database and access retrieval service providers, input service distributors (ISD), tax deducted at source (TDS) deductors, and e-commerce operators collecting TCS.

To file Form GSTR-1, taxpayers need to fulfill certain prerequisites. They should be a registered taxpayer with an active GSTIN during the tax period for which the form needs to be furnished. They should have valid login credentials for the GST Portal and an active and non-expired/revoked digital signature (DSC) if it is mandatory. If taxpayers want to use EVC (Electronic Verification Code), they must have access to the registered mobile number of the Primary Authorized Signatory.

DSC is mandatory for filing returns in case of

Based on the information provided, the taxpayer is required to electronically sign Form GSTR-1 after successfully submitting it. If the form is not electronically signed, it will be considered as not filed. Once the form is successfully submitted and signed, no changes can be made by the taxpayer.

After the successful filing of Form GSTR-1, an Application Reference Number (ARN) is generated. The taxpayer will also receive an SMS and email on the mobile number and email ID of the primary authorized signatory.

There are two ways in which Form GSTR-1 can be electronically signed. Taxpayers can use a Digital Signature Certificate (DSC), which is mandatory for all types of companies and LLPs. Alternatively, they can verify through Electronic Verification Code (EVC) sent to the registered mobile number of the authorized signatory.

When applying a Digital Signature Certificate (DSC), there are certain precautions that need to be taken. The GST Portal only accepts PAN-based DSCs. The DSC must not be expired and must be registered on the GST Portal. The computer must have EM Signer version 2.6 installed, and the DSC dongle must be connected.

If a taxpayer fails to file Form GSTR-1 by the due date, they will receive a system-generated return defaulter notice in format 3A.

It is important for the taxpayer to check the validity of the recipients' GSTIN (Goods and Services Tax Identification Number) furnished in Form GSTR-1. They should only upload the invoice details if the recipient was active on the date of issue of the invoice. If the recipient's GSTIN is not valid, the system will throw a validation error and not accept the invoice details.

All values in Form GSTR-1, such as invoice value, taxable value, and tax amounts, need to be declared up to 2 decimal digits.

There are exceptions to the rule that a taxpayer cannot file Form GSTR-1 before the end of the current tax period. Casual taxpayers, after the closure of their business, can file Form GSTR-1 before the end of the current tax period. Additionally, a taxpayer who has applied for cancellation of registration will be allowed to file Form GSTR-1 after confirmation of receipt of the application before the end of the current tax period.

If a taxpayer is unable to view the invoices they have uploaded, they can scroll down to the bottom of the Form GSTR-1 page and click the "

The text simply provides a list of services related to tax filing, compliance, and financial automation without providing any specific information or details about these services.

However, based on the information provided, it can be concluded that the services mentioned aim to streamline and automate various financial processes, improve efficiency, and ensure compliance with tax regulations. These services may be beneficial for individuals and businesses looking to simplify their tax filing process, manage their financial records, and maximize their tax savings.

For example, the G1-G9 filing ASP/GSP solution mentioned in the text may be a software or platform that helps taxpayers file their GST returns seamlessly. GST (Goods and Services Tax) is a comprehensive indirect tax levied on the supply of goods and services in India. Filing GST returns can be a complex process, and using a software or platform like the G1-G9 filing ASP/GSP solution can help businesses comply with GST regulations and avoid penalties.

Similarly, the text mentions optimizing ITC (Input Tax Credit) for profitability. Input Tax Credit is the credit that a business can claim for the taxes paid on its purchases. By optimizing ITC, businesses can reduce their tax liability and improve their profitability. The text does not provide specific details on how this optimization is achieved, but it can be assumed that the services mentioned may provide guidance and tools to help businesses identify eligible input tax credits and maximize their utilization.

Another service mentioned in the text is maximizing EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) with early vendor payments. EBITDA is a measure of a company's operating performance and profitability. By making early vendor payments, businesses can negotiate discounts or favorable terms with their suppliers, which can improve their EBITDA. The text does not provide specific details on how this service is implemented, but it can be assumed that the services mentioned may provide strategies and tools to help businesses optimize their vendor payment process and maximize their EBITDA.

In addition to these services, the text mentions bulk invoicing within any ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system. An ERP system is a software that integrates various business functions and processes, including finance, sales, inventory, and human resources. Bulk invoicing within an ERP system can help businesses streamline their invoicing process, reduce manual errors, and improve efficiency. The text does not provide specific details

It contains details of outward supplies made by the taxpayer during a specific period. However, there are certain inward supplies that attract reverse charge, which means the liability to pay tax is on the recipient of goods or services instead of the supplier. In this response, we will discuss the key steps for filing the GSTR1, focusing on the details of inward supplies attracting reverse charge.\n\n1. Identify inward supplies attracting reverse charge: The first step is to identify the inward supplies that attract reverse charge. These supplies include goods or services received from an unregistered dealer, specified goods or services notified by the government, and imports of services.\n\n2. Maintain records of inward supplies: It is important to maintain proper records of all inward supplies attracting reverse charge. This includes invoices, bills of entry, and other relevant documents. These records will be required while filing the GSTR1.\n\n3. Determine the tax liability: The next step is to determine the tax liability on the inward supplies attracting reverse charge. The tax rate applicable will depend on the nature of the supplies. For example, goods received from an unregistered dealer attract a 5% tax rate under the reverse charge mechanism.\n\n4. Report the details in GSTR1: Once the tax liability is determined, the taxpayer needs to report the details of inward supplies attracting reverse charge in the GSTR1. This includes the GSTIN of the supplier, invoice details, taxable value, and the amount of tax paid.\n\n5. Reconciliation with GSTR2A: After filing the GSTR1, it is important to reconcile the details with the GSTR2A. GSTR2A is an auto-populated form that contains the details of inward supplies as uploaded by the suppliers. Any discrepancies or mismatches should be rectified before filing the GSTR3.\n\n6. Payment of tax: The tax liability on inward supplies attracting reverse charge needs to be paid by the recipient of goods or services. The payment can be made through the online portal of the Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN) using the appropriate challan.\n\n7. File GSTR3B: Finally, the taxpayer needs to file the GSTR3B, which is a summary return that provides the final tax liability for the month or quarter. The details of inward supplies attracting reverse charge should be included in this return.\n\nIn conclusion,"

---------------- SUMMARY -----------------
The Goods and Services Tax Return 1 (GSTR1) is a monthly or quarterly return that needs to be filed by registered taxpayers in India. It contains details of outward supplies made by the taxpayer during a specific period. However, there are certain inward supplies that attract reverse charge, which means the liability to pay tax is on the recipient of goods or services instead of the supplier. In this response, we will discuss the key steps for filing the GSTR1, focusing on the details of inward supplies attracting reverse charge.

1. Identify inward supplies attracting reverse charge: The first step is to identify the inward supplies that attract reverse charge. These supplies include goods or services received from an unregistered dealer, specified goods or services notified by the government, and imports of services.

2. Maintain records of inward supplies: It is important to maintain proper records of all inward supplies attracting reverse charge. This includes invoices, bills of entry, and other relevant documents. These records will be required while filing the GSTR1.

3. Determine the tax liability: The next step is to determine the tax liability on the inward supplies attracting reverse charge. The tax rate applicable will depend on the nature of the supplies. For example, goods received from an unregistered dealer attract a 5% tax rate under the reverse charge mechanism.

4. Report the details in GSTR1: Once the tax liability is determined, the taxpayer needs to report the details of inward supplies attracting reverse charge in the GSTR1. This includes the GSTIN of the supplier, invoice details, taxable value, and the amount of tax paid.

---------------- SUMMARY -----------------
Unfortunately, without the specific information or text provided, it is not possible to determine the applicable tax period or provide a detailed response on the key steps for filing the GSTR1. However, I can provide a general summary of the GSTR1 filing process.

The GSTR1 is a monthly or quarterly return that needs to be filed by registered taxpayers in India under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime. It contains details of outward supplies made by the taxpayer during the tax period. The tax period for filing GSTR1 depends on the turnover of the taxpayer.

For taxpayers with an annual turnover of up to 1.5 crore INR, the tax period is quarterly. They need to file GSTR1 by the 13th of the month following the end of the quarter. For example, for the quarter ending on March 31st, the GSTR1 needs to be filed by April 13th.

For taxpayers with an annual turnover exceeding 1.5 crore INR, the tax period is monthly. They need to file GSTR1 by the 11th of the following month. For example, for the month of March, the GSTR1 needs to be filed by April 11th.

The key steps for filing GSTR1 include:

1. Collecting and organizing all the necessary information and documents related to outward supplies made during the tax period.

2. Logging into the GST portal using the taxpayer's credentials.

3. Selecting the GSTR1 form and filling in the required details such as the taxpayer's GSTIN, financial year, and tax period.

4. Providing details of outward supplies made to registered taxpayers, including invoice-wise details such as invoice number, date, value, and tax amount.

5. Providing details of outward supplies made to unregistered taxpayers, including consolidated details of the total value and tax amount.

6. Verifying and reconciling the data entered in GSTR1 with the books of accounts to ensure accuracy.

7. Submitting the GSTR1 form electronically on the GST portal.

8. Generating an acknowledgment receipt after successful submission.

GSTR1 is a monthly or quarterly return that needs to be filed by registered taxpayers to provide details of outward supplies made during the reporting period. Here is a detailed response on the requirements and regulations for filing the GSTR1.\n\n1. Registration: The first requirement is to have a valid GST registration. Only registered taxpayers are eligible to file the GSTR1. The registration process involves providing necessary documents and information to the GST authorities.\n\n2. Timely Filing: GSTR1 needs to be filed within the due date specified by the GST authorities. For regular taxpayers, the due date is the 11th of the following month for monthly filers and the 30th of the following month for quarterly filers. It is important to file the return within the due date to avoid penalties and late fees.\n\n3. Reporting of Outward Supplies: GSTR1 requires taxpayers to report details of all outward supplies made during the reporting period. This includes both taxable and exempt supplies. The details to be provided include invoice-wise details of supplies, such as invoice number, date, value, and tax amount.\n\n4. HSN/SAC Codes: Taxpayers need to provide the Harmonized System of Nomenclature (HSN) codes for goods and Services Accounting Codes (SAC) for services in the GSTR1. HSN codes are used to classify goods for taxation purposes, while SAC codes are used for services. These codes help in the proper categorization of supplies.\n\n5. Amendments and Corrections: If any amendments or corrections need to be made to the GSTR1 already filed, taxpayers can do so in the subsequent return period. However, it is important to note that amendments can only be made for the previous financial year up to the due date of filing the September return or the annual return, whichever is earlier.\n\n6. Nil Return Filing: Even if there are no outward supplies during a particular period, taxpayers are required to file a nil return. This ensures compliance with the GST regulations and avoids any penalties for non-filing.\n\n7. Digital Signature: GSTR1 needs to be digitally signed using a valid digital signature certificate (DSC) or an electronic verification code (EVC). This ensures the authenticity and integrity of the return filed.\n\n8. Reconciliation: Taxpayers need to reconcile the data reported in G"

---------------- SUMMARY -----------------
GSTR1 filing guidelines are crucial for businesses in India to comply with the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regulations. GSTR1 is a monthly or quarterly return that needs to be filed by registered taxpayers to provide details of their outward supplies. This return is essential for the government to track and verify the tax liabilities of businesses. In this response, we will delve into the guidelines for filing GSTR1, providing a detailed overview of the process and its significance.

The GSTR1 filing process involves several steps that businesses need to follow to ensure accurate reporting of their outward supplies. The guidelines for filing GSTR1 can be summarized as follows:

1. Reporting Period: Businesses need to determine whether they are required to file GSTR1 on a monthly or quarterly basis. The filing frequency depends on the taxpayer's turnover, with businesses with an annual turnover of up to 1.5 crore filing quarterly, and those with a turnover above 1.5 crore filing monthly.

2. Reporting Details: Businesses need to provide comprehensive details of their outward supplies, including invoices issued, credit notes, debit notes, and advances received. These details should be accurately reported in the GSTR1 form.

3. HSN/SAC Codes: Taxpayers need to report the Harmonized System of Nomenclature (HSN) codes for goods and Services Accounting Codes (SAC) for services in their GSTR1. These codes help in classifying the supplies and determining the applicable tax rates.

4. Invoice-level Information: GSTR1 requires businesses to report invoice-level information for B2B (business-to-business) supplies. This includes details such as invoice number, date, value, and tax amount. It is essential to ensure that all invoices are reported accurately to avoid any discrepancies.

5. Nil Returns: Even if there are no outward supplies during a particular period, businesses are required to file nil returns for GSTR1. This helps in maintaining compliance and avoiding penalties.

6. Timely Filing: GSTR1 needs to be filed within the due date specified by the government. Late filing attracts penalties, so businesses must ensure timely submission to avoid any financial implications.

7. Reconciliation: It is crucial for businesses to reconcile the data reported in GSTR1 with their books of accounts to ensure accuracy. Any discrepancies should be rectified promptly to avoid any issues during audits or assessments.

Filing GSTR1 accurately and on time is of utmost importance for businesses to maintain compliance with GST regulations

GSTR1 is a monthly or quarterly return that needs to be filed by registered taxpayers to provide details of their outward supplies of goods or services. This return is crucial for the government to monitor and analyze business transactions, ensure tax compliance, and prevent tax evasion.\n\nThe GSTR1 filing process has been designed to be user-friendly and efficient, with the aim of simplifying tax filing for businesses. Taxpayers can file their GSTR1 returns online through the Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN) portal. The portal provides a secure and reliable platform for taxpayers to submit their returns and access various other services related to GST.\n\nTo file GSTR1, taxpayers need to provide details such as their GSTIN (Goods and Services Tax Identification Number), the period for which the return is being filed, and information about their outward supplies. This includes details of invoices issued, credit notes, debit notes, and any amendments made to these documents. Taxpayers also need to provide information about exports, supplies made to SEZs (Special Economic Zones), and supplies made through e-commerce operators.\n\nThe GSTR1 filing process has been integrated with the GSTN, which ensures accuracy and reduces errors. The system automatically validates the data provided by taxpayers and generates a summary of the return. Taxpayers can review and make any necessary corrections before finalizing and submitting the return.\n\nOne of the key benefits of the GSTR1 filing process is the increased transparency it brings to the tax system. By providing detailed information about their outward supplies, taxpayers enable the government to have a better understanding of business transactions and identify any potential discrepancies. This helps in reducing tax evasion and improving tax administration.\n\nThe GSTR1 filing process also facilitates better monitoring and analysis of business transactions.

GSTR1 is a monthly or quarterly return that businesses need to file to provide details of their outward supplies, including invoice-wise information, tax rates, and Harmonized System of Nomenclature (HSN) codes.

To file GSTR1, businesses need to follow a step-by-step process. Firstly, they need to log in to the GST portal using their credentials. Once logged in, they can navigate to the GSTR1 section and select the relevant tax period for which they want to file the return. The portal provides an easy-to-use interface where businesses can enter the required details.

The filing process involves providing information about outward supplies made during the tax period. This includes details such as the invoice number, date, and value of supplies, along with the applicable tax rates and HSN codes. Businesses need to ensure that the information provided is accurate and complete to avoid any discrepancies or penalties.

The online portal also allows businesses to save their progress and complete the filing process in multiple sessions. This flexibility is particularly helpful for businesses with a large volume of transactions or complex supply chains. It ensures that businesses can accurately report their outward supplies without feeling rushed or overwhelmed.

Once all the required details have been entered, businesses can preview the GSTR1 return before final submission. This allows them to review the information and make any necessary corrections or additions. Once satisfied with the accuracy of the return, businesses can submit it electronically through the portal.

The government has made efforts to simplify the GSTR1 filing process to reduce the compliance burden on businesses. The user-friendly online portal has significantly streamlined the process, making it easier for businesses to meet their reporting obligations. This has resulted in increased compliance rates and improved transparency in the tax system.

In conclusion, the process of filing GSTR1 has been simplified through the introduction of a user-friendly online portal. Businesses can easily provide details of their outward supplies, including invoice-wise information, tax rates, and HSN codes. The step-by-step process ensures accuracy and completeness in reporting, while the flexibility of saving progress allows businesses to file the return at their own pace.
